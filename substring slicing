To extract substrings from a string, you can use slicing with appropriate start and stop indices:


text = "Hello, World!"

# Extracting "Hello"
substring1 = text[0:5]
print(substring1)  # Output: Hello

# Extracting "World"
substring2 = text[7:12]
print(substring2)  # Output: World

# Extracting "World!" from the 7th index to the end
substring3 = text[7:]
print(substring3)  # Output: World!

# Extracting "Hello, World!" from the start to the 12th index
substring4 = text[:13]
print(substring4)  # Output: Hello, World!
